<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>My name is Ashley Kiara Carhuavilca Espinoza</h2>

<p>I'm from Lima, Peru, an amazing place with delicious food, rich culture, and strong traditions. I used to study at Innova Schools in Peru. To be honest, sometimes I want to go back just to hang out with my friends, see them all, stress about the easy homework, and play volleyball all afternoon. But that is another story.</p>

<p>Besides my feelings of solitude, I have a hobby that I once thought I was bad at: drawing and painting, especially in a surrealist style. These are the most interesting ways, in my perspective, to represent any type of idea. My favorite artist is Salvador Dalí. Although some might have a biased opinion about him because of his personality, it is not an impediment for me to separate the artist from the person and appreciate his artwork.</p>
