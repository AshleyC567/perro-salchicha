<h1>Further explanation of what a plastic surgeon is and does and its benefits to persue this career:</h1>
<p>Plastic surgeons are licensed medical doctors who perform reconstructive and cosmetic procedures. Plastic surgeons may work on any area of the body in general or may specialize in a particular area, such as the face or hands. Plastic surgeons may administer cosmetic procedures to restore the patient’s appearance following an accident, disease or cancer or they may treat the bones of the skull or face.
While they may share some similar duties to cosmetic surgeons, who perform surgical procedures for aesthetic purposes, plastic surgeons typically perform reconstructive surgery and replace or repair body parts damaged by malformation, illness or accidents. While their responsibilities vary depending on their area of specialization, some of their general responsibilities include</p>
<ul>
<li>Examining patients to assess any deformity or illness and applying the appropriate medical treatment, either reconstructive or cosmetic</li>
<li>Explaining the treatment solution to patients, including the risks and dangers of surgical treatments</li>
<li>Following up with patients after treatment and providing any necessary follow-up care</li>
<li>Performing non-invasive procedures as necessary to restore the appearance</li>
<li>Assessing a patient’s psychological health before and after treatment</li>
<li>Maintaining the confidentiality of patient information</li>
</ul>
